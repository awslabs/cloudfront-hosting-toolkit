## FAQ

**Is it necessary to acquire a domain name in advance or before deploying my website?**

  Yes, it's advisable to acquire your desired domain name before configuring it for your website if you want to associate a custom domain name with your website. You have the flexibility to purchase the domain name either through your AWS account or from any other DNS provider of your choice. This ensures that you have ownership and control over the domain name as you proceed with the website configuration.


**I've successfully deployed my website using the tool, and now I'd like to configure a custom domain name. What are the steps I should follow?**

  To use a domain name for your deployed website, follow these steps:

  - Run the `init` command again to initiate the setup process.

  - During the setup process, select the option that allows you to specify your desired domain name.

  - Once you've made the desired domain name selection, proceed with the deployment by running the `deploy` command.

Yes, you can. 
The tool is designed to be versatile and adaptable to your specific needs. If you've built your website without utilizing any frontend framework, our tool will automatically detect that no framework is in use. As a result, there won't be any build step required.
