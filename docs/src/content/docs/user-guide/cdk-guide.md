CloudFront Hosting Toolkit offers two primary methods for integration with AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit):

1. **CDK Construct**: Use the CloudFront Hosting Toolkit as a pre-built construct in your existing CDK project. This method is ideal if you want to quickly integrate the toolkit's functionality without modifying its core logic.
